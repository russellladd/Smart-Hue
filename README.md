# Smart Hue

Smart Hue is a sample iOS app made for beginner's workshops.

The app is basically a smart home controller, allowing you to choose a color and making the lights in your current room turn that color.

The app heavily exercises UI skills, but iBeacons and NSURLSession are also used.

Specialized server software and a Philips Hue set are required to complete this app.
